-Figure out how to parse cpu.sh output to match what the database expects to facilitate QR scanning

-Make scripts that require a specific program check for it and call installprogs.sh if it doesn't exist

-Make scripts only show output that I intend. No status or error messages.

-Make webcam.sh check for file existence rather than displaying it.

-Make each script format its output differently based on arguments when calling it.
	-Null argument is standard human readable
	-qr outputs qr codes
	-xml outputs White-Canyon/Makor compatible xml format
	-master formats info in a way that is easily readable in combination with many other scripts

-complete keyboard.sh
	-Create a master file of keycodes to be checked against
	-Script will generate a log file of keycodes pressed using showkey
	-Script will compare generated log file to master list and output a list of keys not pressed and write that list to file
	-Script will offer a chance to retry comparing to unpressed keys file instead of master

-add universe and multiverse to installprogs for ubuntu
